\idx[main=y]{Terrain Types}\label{terrain_types}

\subsection{Dangerous Terrain (X)}
\idx[main=y]{Dangerous Terrain}\label{dangerous_terrain}

A model must take a Dangerous Terrain Test if it is in contact with a Terrain Feature that counts as Dangerous Terrain at any point during its March, Charge, Failed Charge, Flee, Pursuit, or Overrun Move. Take a Dangerous Terrain Test by rolling a number of D6 depending on the model's Height and Model Rules:

\vspace*{-2pt}\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lcccc}%
	\hline
	& \textbf{\heightstandard} & \textbf{\heightlarge} & \textbf{\heightgigantic} & \textbf{\chariot}\tabularnewline
	D6 & 1 & 2 & 3 & +1 \tabularnewline
	\hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}

For each dice that rolled equal to or below X (where X is the value stated in brackets), the model suffers a hit with Armour Penetration 10 that wounds automatically.

Immediately before one or more models in a unit take a Dangerous Terrain Test (e.g. when the first model in a unit moves into contact with a Terrain Feature that counts as Dangerous Terrain), apply the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interrupt the move.
	\item Determine which models will have to take Dangerous Terrain Tests by extrapolating the unit's move to the position where the corresponding models are in contact with the source of the Dangerous Terrain Tests. For this purpose, the owner announces how they intend to move the unit to this position.
	\item Take the Dangerous Terrain Tests. All Dangerous Terrain Tests caused by a single source are always taken at the same time.
	\item Move the unit as announced or as close to that as possible while following any other rules affecting the move (e.g. Maximising Contact during Charge Moves), i.e. it must face the announced direction and the centre of its Front Facing must be as close to the position where it would be if the unit had not suffered any casualties.
	\item Continue the unit's move. In case of a March Move, the owner may choose not to continue moving the unit. No model in the unit that did not take a Dangerous Terrain Test for the Terrain Feature may move into contact with that Terrain Feature during the rest of the unitâ€™s move. Note that:
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hits suffered from Dangerous Terrain Tests are distributed onto the model's Health Pool.
	\item A model never takes more than one Dangerous Terrain Test for the same Terrain Feature during a single move, but it might have to take several Dangerous Terrain Tests caused by different Terrain Features or abilities.
	\item Use the position of the unit when taking the Dangerous Terrain Tests for all rules purposes (e.g. for determining the range of \hyperref[commanding_presence]{Commanding Presence} and \hyperref[rally_around_the_flag]{Rally Around the Flag}, for determining the direction of the Flee Move if the unit fails a Panic Test, for causing Panic Tests in friendly units if the unit is removed as a casualty, etc.).
\end{itemize}
	


\subsection{Opaque Terrain}
\idx[main=y]{Opaque Terrain}\label{opaque_terrain}

Line of Sight cannot be drawn through Opaque Terrain, but can be drawn into it. Models always ignore any Terrain they are inside for drawing Line of Sight.

\subsection{Covering Terrain}
\idx{Cover}\idx[main=y]{Covering Terrain}\label{covering_terrain}

Like models, Terrain Features may contribute to Cover when obscuring a fraction of the Target Facing or the Target Point from the enemy's Line of Sight (see \totalref{cover}, and remember that Cover modifiers only apply if more than half of the Target Facing or the Target Point is obscured by Cover).

For the purpose of counting as Cover, Terrain Features may distinguish:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Targets obscured \textbf{behind} the Terrain Feature. These units must have more than half of their Target Facing or their Target Point off the Terrain Feature, and the part of the Terrain Feature obscuring Line of Sight must be between the shooting model and its target.
	\item Targets obscured \textbf{inside} the Terrain Feature. These units must have more than half of their Target Facing or their Target Point inside the Terrain Feature.
	\item Targets obscured \textbf{behind and/or inside} the Terrain Feature: there is no need to determine where more than half of these units' Target Facing or their Target Point lies (as long as it is obscured).
\end{itemize}

Models always ignore any Terrain they are inside for drawing Line of Sight.
