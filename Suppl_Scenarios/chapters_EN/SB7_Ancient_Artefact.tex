\label{AncientArtefact}

\flufffont{Your army was drawn here by the rumours of a valuable artefact of a forgotten age, but so was the army of your foe. Show them who's boss!}

\subsection*{Deployment}

Standard Deployment Type: Refused Flank.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

Place a small Impassable Terrain Feature (approximately \distance{3\timess{}3}) suitable to represent the Ancient Artefact in the centre of the board, or, if there already is another Terrain Feature there, as close as possible to the centre of the board, but at least \distance{1} away from other Terrain Features. In case you don't have any suitable Impassable Terrain Feature available, you may mark the centre of the board as the Ancient Artefact with a marker instead.
