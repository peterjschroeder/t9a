\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

At the end of step 6 of the Pre-Game Sequence (immediately after determining Deployment Zones), both players must place a Strategic Objective anywhere on the Battlefield entirely outside their own Deployment Zone and at least \distance{1} away from Impassable Terrain, starting with the player who chose their Deployment Zone. 

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

\newcommand{\strategicobjective}{Strategic Objective}
\newcommand{\unmovable}{Unmoveable}
\newcommand{\unmovabledef}{%
	The Strategic Objective cannot move in any way once deployed, and for rules purposes its Pursuit and Overrun Distance is always \distance{0}. It cannot be joined by Characters.%

	During step 7 of the Deployment Phase Sequence (after moving Vanguarding units but before rolling for first turn), each player must give their own Strategic Objective 2 upgrades from the list belowstarting with the player who chose their Deployment Zone:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \magicresistance{4}
	\item \aegis{5+}
	\item \fortitude{4}
	\item Armour \textbf{set} to 4

\subsection*{Winning the Scenario}

A player is immediately declared the winner when their opponent's Strategic Objective is removed as a casualty or when all enemy units have been removed as casualties. If no winner has been declared after 7 Game Turns, the game is a draw.
