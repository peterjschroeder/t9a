\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

Place the Stout Marker at the centre of the board.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

At the start of each of your Player Turns, except for the first, any of your Scoring Units may pick up the Stout Marker if they are in contact with its centre. Remove the marker from the Battlefield: the unit is now carrying the marker.

Units carrying the marker with less than 3 Full Ranks cannot perform March Moves.

If a unit that is carrying the Stout Marker is destroyed or Flees, the opponent must immediately place the marker with its centre on a point within \distance{3} of the unit. This point cannot be within \distance{1} of Impassable Terrain, but can be inside a unit.

The unit carrying the Stout Marker gains \textbf{Fearless}.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, if a unit is carrying the Stout Marker, its owner wins the Secondary Objective.
