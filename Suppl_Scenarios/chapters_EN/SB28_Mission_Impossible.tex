\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

\subsubsection*{Secret Agent}

After step 8 of the Pre-Game Sequence (immediately before the Deployment Phase), both players must secretly nominate a single unit from their opponent's Army List worth at least 200 points and consisting of at least 5 models of Standard Height or 3 models of Large Height (write it down on a piece of paper). This unit contains your Spy.
			
At the start of your opponent's Player Turn, you can have your Spy sabotage the unit it is in. To do so, simply reveal your choice of unit. The sabotaged unit cannot Charge in the following Charge Phase and cannot voluntarily move in the following Movement Phase.

\subsection*{Winning the Scenario}

To win the scenario, you must rescue your Spy in order to retrieve the valuable information collected. A Spy is considered rescued when the unit the Spy is hidden in is removed as a casualty. If you manage to rescue your Spy while your opponent doesn't rescue theirs, you win this scenario.
