\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, players are awarded Victory Counters for each zone in which they have at least one Scoring Unit:

\begin{itemize}
\item The opponent's Deployment Zone -- 3 counters
\item The zones adjacent to the Deployment Zones -- 2 counters each
\item Your own Deployment Zone -- 1 counter
\item The centre zone -- 0 counters
\end{itemize}

A unit is considered to be in a zone if its Centre is inside it.

The player with the most Victory Counters wins this Secondary Objective.
