\flufffont{Mist shrouds these long forgotten ruins, though somewhere a treasure is hidden. You cannot risk sending your entire force in at once, going forward without a vanguard would be foolish.}

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

During step 6 of the Pre-Game Sequence, immediately after it has been determined which player will be choosing their Deployment Zone but before the choice has been made, the player not choosing their Deployment Zone must choose a single Terrain Feature on the Battlefield. This Terrain Feature is known as the Lost Vault.

When declaring Special Deployment, during step 8 of the Pre-Game Sequence, both players alternately choose two of their units each to gain \textbf{Vanguard}, starting with the player that chose their Deployment Zone. Lone Characters cannot be chosen.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, the player with the most Scoring Units within \distance{6} of the Lost Ruins wins this Secondary Objective.
