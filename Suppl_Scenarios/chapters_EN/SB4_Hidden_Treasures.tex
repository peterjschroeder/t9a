\subsection*{Special Scenario Rules}

At the start of each Game Turn, roll a D3. Place a Treasure Marker with its centre on the Centre Line, at the position corresponding to the result of the dice. If there is already one marker at the position, don't place any markers during this Game Turn.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, the player who controls the most Treasure Markers wins this Secondary Objective. A Treasure Marker is controlled by the player with the most Scoring Units within \distance{6} of the centre of the marker. If a unit is within \distance{6} of the centres of more than one marker, it only counts as within \distance{6} of the centre of the marker which is closest to its Centre (randomise if both markers' centres are equally close).
