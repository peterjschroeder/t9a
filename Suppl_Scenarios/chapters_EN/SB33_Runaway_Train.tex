\flufffont{An Infernal Dwarves train loaded with valuable warpstone is headed for a safe passage. Two armies will both try to steal as much of the cargo as possible before the train makes its escape into the mountains.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

Standard Deployment Type: Frontline Clash.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

Set up the Battlefield with a line between the short Board Edges representing the track on which the Train will move. The line may be curved, however, the curves must be balanced with how close they are positioned to each player's Deployment Zone. Place an objective in the form of a Train with a base of approximately \distance{6\timess{}2} on the tracks with its back against a randomly determined short Board Edge. For rules purposes, the train counts as Impassable Terrain.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

\subsubsection*{Fully Loaded Train}

At the beginning of each Player Turn, roll 2D6: this is the distance in inches the Train travels forwards on the track.

If the Train comes into contact with a unit during its travel, it immediately stops (in base contact, without aligning) and the unit suffers 6D6 hits with Strength 4 and Armour Penetration 1. The unit is Shaken until the end of the Player Turn.

\subsection*{Winning the Scenario}

At the start of each Player Turn, starting with Game Turn 2, the player with the closest Scoring Unit to the Train, as long as it is at least within \distance{6}, gains 1 Victory Counter. If there is a tie, no Victory Counter is awarded that Player Turn. A maximum of 6 Victory Counters total can be awarded this way.

At the end of the game, the player with the most Victory Counters wins the game.
