\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

After Spell Selection (at the end of step 7 of the Pre-Game Sequence), the players take turns marking 3 different Terrain Features (in total) that are not Impassable Terrain and that are not entirely within their Deployment Zone, starting with the player that chose their Deployment Zone.

During step 7 of the Deployment Phase Sequence (after moving Vanguarding units and before rolling for first turn), both players secretly choose which of the marked Terrain Features the Grail is hidden in (write it down on a piece of paper).

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

At the start of Game Turn 2, the choices of Terrain Features are revealed. If both players chose the same one, place the Grail Marker at the centre of that Terrain Feature. Otherwise, place the Grail Marker at the centre of the marked Terrain Feature none of the players chose.

At the start of each following Player Turn, any of the Active Player's Scoring Units may pick up the Grail Marker if they are in contact with its centre. Remove the marker from the Battlefield: the unit is now carrying the marker. Units carrying the marker with less than 3 Full Ranks cannot perform March Moves.

If a unit that is carrying the Grail Marker is destroyed or Flees, the opponent must immediately place the marker with its centre on a point within \distance{3} of the unit. This point cannot be within \distance{1} of Impassable Terrain, but can be inside a unit.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, if a unit is carrying the Grail Marker, its owner wins this Secondary Objective.
