\flufffont{Two scheming lords vie for the throne and the time has come for a decisive battle. However, they will both need to be in the thick of it at the point of victory to claim absolute authority in the moment of victory.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

Deployment Zones are areas more than \distance{10} away from the Centre Line. Only models that are Cavalry, have Light Troops and/or Scout may be deployed within \distance{12} of the short Board Edges.

When declaring Special Deployment, players may choose to keep up to two of their units as reinforcement. These units follow the rules for Ambushing units, except that they automatically arrive in Game Turn 1, and must be placed touching the owner's long Board Edge.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

Immediately before determining the Deployment Zones, both players must secretly choose one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Any friendly non-Character unit to conceal the army's Hidden King
\item Any friendly Character to be the army's Hidden King
\end{itemize}

Write the chosen unit/Character down on a piece of paper.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

At the start of each Player Turn, the Active Player may choose one of the Reactive Player's units. This player must reveal if the Hidden King resides in this unit. He doesn't have to reveal who the Hidden King is in the unit.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, if your Hidden King is alive and the opponent's has been removed as a casualty, you win this Secondary Objective.
