\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

During step 7 of the Deployment Phase Sequence (after moving Vanguarding units and before rolling for first turn), both players take turns in openly choosing three Charactersfrom their opponent's Army List, starting with the player that finished deploying first. If a there are less than three Characters in an Army List, the opponent automatically chooses all Characters instead. Characters currently not on the board (e.g. if Ambushing) may still be chosen.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, the player that has the highest number of their chosen Characters still alive wins this Secondary Objective.
