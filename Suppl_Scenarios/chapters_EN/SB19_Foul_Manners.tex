\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

During step 7 of the Deployment Phase Sequence (after moving Vanguarding units and before rolling for first turn), both players must choose one of their own units, starting with the player that finished deploying first. The chosen units gain \textbf{Foul Manners}.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

\subsubsection*{Foul Manners}

All units gain \textbf{Frenzy} with the exception that only enemy units with Foul Manners trigger a Frenzy Test for this instance of Frenzy.

Each time an enemy unit fails a Frenzy Test triggered by a unit with Foul Manners, you gain a Victory Counter. If the enemy unit is Scoring, you gain an additional Victory Counter. 

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, the player with the most Victory Counters wins this Secondary Objective.
