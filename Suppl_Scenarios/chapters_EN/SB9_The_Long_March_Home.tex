\label{TheLongMarchHome}

\flufffont{The long war is just about over, and your army has just started the long march home, only to find your path blocked by yet another foe. Push past them as quickly as you can, and if some were to fall, that just means a few less mouths to feed on the way home.}

\subsection*{Deployment}

Standard Deployment Type: Marching Columns.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

Once a player has deployed all of their units (excluding units that use Special Deployment such as Ambush or Scout) and declared his intent to go first or second, that player must place a marker with its centre within their opponent's Deployment Zone. The other player then deploys their remaining units and places a marker with its centre within their opponent's Deployment Zone. Continue with step 5 of the Deployment Phase Sequence (deployment of Scouting units) as usual.

\subsection*{Scenario Special Rules}

When calculating Victory Points, Core Units are worth half of their normal Point Cost (also when Fleeing and/or Shattered).

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

The player with the most Scoring Units within \distance{6} of the marker they placed at the end of the game wins this Secondary Objective.
