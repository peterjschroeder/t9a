\subsection*{Deployment}

Deployment Zones are areas more than \distance{10} away from the Centre Line. Only models that are Cavalry, have Light Troops and/or Scout may be deployed within \distance{12} of the short Board Edges.

When declaring Special Deployment, players may choose to keep up to two of their units as reinforcement. These units follow the rules for Ambushing units, except that they automatically arrive in Game Turn 1, and must be placed touching the owner's long Board Edge.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

During step 7 of the Deployment Phase Sequence (after moving Vanguarding units and before rolling for first turn), both players take turns in openly choosing three units with a Standard Bearer (excluding the Battle Standard Bearer) from their opponent's Army List, starting with the player that finished deploying first. If there are less than three units with a Standard Bearer in an Army List, the opponent automatically chooses all units with a Standard Bearer instead. If there are none in the army, the opponent chooses a single Scoring Unit instead. Units currently not on the board (such as Ambushing units) may still be chosen.

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, the player that has the highest number of their chosen units still alive wins this Secondary Objective.
