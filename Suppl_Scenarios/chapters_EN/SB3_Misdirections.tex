\subsection*{Deployment}

Standard Deployment Type: Counterthrust.

\subsection*{Pre-Game Set-up}

After determining Deployment Zones, both players alternately place two markers each on the Battlefield, starting with the player that chose their Deployment Zone. Each marker has to be placed with its center on a point that is within \distance{6} of the Centre Line and at least \distance{6} away from the Board Edge. In the figure below, this area is marked in orange. In addition, each marker must be placed with its centre at least \distance{11} away from any other marker's centre and more than \distance{1} away from Impassable Terrain.

Label the markers with numbers from 1 to 4. During step 7 of the Deployment Phase Sequence, each player secretly chooses one of the markers (write down its number on a piece of paper). Players may choose freely between markers placed by themselves and by their opponent.

\subsection*{Special Scenario Rules}

At the end of Game Turn 5, both players reveal which marker they chose. 

\subsection*{Winning the Secondary Objective}

At the end of the game, the player controlling most of the chosen markers wins this Secondary Objective. A marker is controlled by the player with the most Scoring Units within \distance{6} of the centre of the marker. If a unit is within \distance{6} of the centre of both markers, it only counts as within \distance{6} of the centre of the marker which is closest to its Centre (randomise if both markers' centres are equally close).
