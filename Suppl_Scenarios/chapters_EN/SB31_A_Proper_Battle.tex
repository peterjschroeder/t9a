\subsection*{Winning the Scenario}

During the game, a player gains one Victory Counter if they are the first to be in any of the following situation:
\begin{itemize}
\item An enemy Scoring Unit is removed as a casualty.
\item A friendly unit successfully Charges an enemy unit.
\item An enemy unit of Gigantic Height or with War Machine is removed as a casualty.
\end{itemize}

At the end of the game, determine each player's most expensive unit that was removed as a casualty (based on the Point Costs on the Army List; in case of Combined Units, count joined Characters separately). The player with the less expensive unit out of these units gains 1 Victory Counter, and each player gains 1 Victory Counter if their opponent's General has been removed as a casualty.\newline
The player with the most Victory Counters wins the game.
