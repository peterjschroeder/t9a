	I left home, like all my friends, and travelled. Most of us walk, we want to see as much as possible. Me, I always liked boats. So I made a boat, and I paddled down the Big River. When I couldn't see the hills I grew up in, I knew I was far from home. I got the boat on land, and found some animals---pink ones that made cute squeaking noises. After I ate ten, I fell asleep by the river.%

	I woke up, and I couldn't stand up. Tried to look down. It was difficult, but I saw tiny little threads, crissycrossing my whole body. Legs, arms, even my fingers got tied to the ground. I turned my head, and saw a tiny person looking at me, with a bow and an arrow. I thought he was angry, but then he dropped the arrow when he saw me look. Poor scared little one, I thought.%

	\enquote{\textbf{No need to be scaredy}}, I said, \enquote{\textbf{I am here to be a friend.}} He squeaked---almost like the pink animals, and he shot me in the eye. Lots of little sharp things stabbed me all over. Only a little bit sore, but the eye hurt! I got a bit mad, and pushed myself up, snapping all the little ropes. Most of the little bow--people ran off, but the one by my head fell over. I could see he was shaking. He thought I would eat him! I picked him up very gently, not so angry now I was free.%

	\enquote{\textbf{It's ok, little friend, I won't eat. I am Rociver, and I want to make friends.}} It took a while, but he finally believed me. He told me I had eaten his \enquote{pigs} and he would be hungry. I was sad for my new friend, Michal. He took me to the boss of their village. Many of the little people guarded me, pointing sticks. The boss was scared and angry and very quiet. I had to bend down to hear him. I gave him my best smile, and he fell over all sleepy. When he woke up, everyone agreed I could stay to help Michal to make more food, but I had to be careful, and no more smiling. Very serious little people.%

	Michal and me worked hard. We fished the river and I only ate some. We grew many \enquote{pigs} and I only ate some. We gathered big fruits and I only ate some. We hunted things and I only ate some. I learned lots, Michal told me things and I wrote some down to take home. Michal now had more pigs than when I got to Littleplace, but he was not happy. He always wanted more pigs. The village boss died, poor little boss, and Michal was the new boss because he had all the pigs. He told me \enquote{Roc, you must work harder. You ate my pigs, remember?}%

	Rociver is a clever giant. I can count. I eat ten pigs. Then I help make many more pigs. My friend Michal is not a good counter. But it is nearly home time, and I am tired from farming, so I decide to help him. I walk to neighbours and get more pigs, then put them in Michal's field. First he is happy, and he tells me to \enquote{shhh}. Then the village people get angry, and he points to me. \enquote{Rociver has taken your pigs, he is to blame.} I am sad, my friend must be scared of the other little people. So I say \enquote{\textbf{Sorry}}, I stand up and smile at everyone. Lots of them fall over and some scream. I think they must be happy now. I leave, only taking two pigs for the road.%

	Now I am on my way home. I have travelled and met new people. I have learned lessons and I made new friends. I bring tools made for me, and my mum and dad will be proud. Now it is time for me to grow up and to learn to be a proper giant.%

	Inquisitor General, I write this cipher in hope it will reach you. Sunna willing, I shall survive this day, but I fear my final hour may be near. As ordered, I have infiltrated the cabal of cultists at the heart of the merchant district. Gaining their trust has been a slow process. Even now, I know the names of only a handful of the lowest ranking members. Only the Cult Leader knows the true scope of this cancerous group's reach.\DTLpar
	Today marked a surge in their confidence. The full cabal met for the first time to my knowledge. Dozens of robed members, each in a grotesque mask, gathered into a tavern back room which was surprisingly spacious, easily fifteen feet to the top of the vaulted ceiling. The meeting changes location each time, yet somehow a large stone altar is always present, flanked by great bronze candelabras, casting a flickering glow over the gathering, throwing deep shadows into the corners.\DTLpar
	The Leader was already chanting in her hypnotic voice when I shuffled into the back of the meeting, having given the relevant passcode to the hulking bouncer guarding the door. I caught snippets of speech from the front, references to the greatest of weapons, a perfect tool to overthrow the Elector of this region, while the Leader gestured to a huge, cloth-covered mound to her side.\DTLpar
	Then the mound stirred, and rose! A colossal form, shrouded in its own dark cloak, its head reached the rafters and it stooped over the gathering, bringing its daemonic, iron-forged mask close to us, foetid breath wafting through the room. Through narrow slits I could see eyes that burned with a bright green flame, and I felt that they saw through every bit of my subterfuge. As the gathered cultists cheered and whooped in triumph, I staggered to the jakes, feigning the need to pass water, barely holding my supper down. This scrawled note is my last hope of reaching you in time---they have turned a giant, we are lost!%

	Last night our town was attacked. A mere day's travel from the settlement of Alfhaven, we should have been safe from the ravages of brigands. Yet the Dread Elf corsairs are no ordinary threat. They attacked at dusk, when our watch was lowest, and when no ordinary captain would have risked a landing. Still, even with little notice, a defence was assembled which should have withstood the two attacking ships.\DTLpar
	Then one of those vessels, already sitting low in the water, rocked violently, and a monstrous shape vaulted its rail. Waves swept the dock, unsteadying the men who waited with levelled spears. A giant, on a ship! Armed with a cruel blade, it charged, scattering soldiers before it. It fought with no great skill, yet each stab of that wicked sword twisted brutally, ensuring death came to all it struck.\DTLpar
	The worst was still to come. As it approached a watchtower, with a great brazier casting light upon the beast, we saw its face. A horrifying visage, it struck terror in our hearts, an inked pattern of snakes writhing around glittering eyes. Meanwhile, the raiders rounded up captives, the giant himself grabbing up half a dozen and tossing them to the deck, pushing the ship into deeper waters before clambering aboard. By the time artillery was brought to bear, they had vanished once more into the night, and we were left to pick up the pieces.%

	I have conducted an extensive review into the proposed use of giants in our military. First, as expected, they are large and fearfully strong. Surprisingly, the few we encountered have shown willingness to learn our ways, and have proven adequate in their martial training. Still, they lack dedication, and are prone to wandering off once the novelty of a Sonnstahl life has worn off. We've lost several pieces of custom equipment that way.\DTLpar
	However, I have a more pressing concern than their wayward attention-span: some giants have taken to the preaching of our prelates. I could hardly have believed they would embrace Sunna so fervently, yet I have seen one of their number fight long after her wounds seemed sure to overwhelm her, with a tenacity usually reserved for the wildest of flagellants.\DTLpar
	Such ardent faith has the potential to be a valuable tool, yet given their natural tendency towards destructive anger if provoked, I worry that the average soldier may prove too flippant for safety. I've broken up brawls between zealots and heavy infantry due to an errant \enquote{Sunna damn}---should a giant enter the fray, our own armies could crumble.

Our ship, laden with figs and pomegranates, should unload as soon as possible, lest these delicate crops spoil. Yet we wait on the whims of these isles' lords.\DTLpar
	Our arrival was not without incident. The great Rock, upon which all vessels must moor, was very crowded. As we searched for a place to berth, an unexpected wave rocked our ship.

	As night drew its dark veil upon the day, we approached the camp of the Great Khan Khuchar, deep in the frigid heart of the Sky Mountains, towering high above the world. Dusk flows fitfully here, shadows growing by the moment, yet we drew close and resolved to pierce the gloom's heart and arrive by evening feast.\DTLpar
	Upon the ice wind that moaned through canyon and cavern, stirring cloaks and biting flesh, we heard a more mournful cry still. A deep and ululating groan, that clutched at heart and throat, so struck through with grief was it, that each mortal present contemplated their deepest sorrows. Feet faltered, and I grew afeared that we might fail to overcome the woeful dirge, and would succumb to the terrible siren song.\DTLpar
	Yet at last we saw the lights of campfires ahead, and banners lit by golden light proclaimed the majesty of their Khan. Our pack horses forged ahead, bearing the wealth we sought to trade with our Gyengget hosts. We drew near to two rock monoliths flanking the approach, only for that forlorn song to end abruptly, and the columns resolved into towering guards, armed with fearsome weapons of iron and bronze. Only a flurry of pleas, proffers of gifts and pledges of respect saw our hides spared the fate of intruders upon custom.\DTLpar
	Led by one of these titanic beings to the tent of the Great Khan, we were finally confronted by the lord and master of these lands, and of the souls of the immense wardens. Our escort prostrated herself before the Khan, abasing herself in the most serpentine of crawls. Our faces must have displayed our shock, as the Khan roared with mirth, his tremendous bulk rippling. This good humour boded well, despite the late hour of our arrival, yet we could not fail to feel a chill that had no root in the icy weather.

Good soldiers fell beside me, but we broke their lines, circling to launch another attack.\DTLpar

The figure that loomed in the Beacon's stead bellowed incoherently, raising a hand, and two more of my comrades fell beneath a lash of green energy.
