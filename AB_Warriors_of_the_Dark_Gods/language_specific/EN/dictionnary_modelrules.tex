		\item They may declare Flee as a Charge Reaction even if they have Fearless.%
		\item Their Rally Test in their next Player Turn after voluntarily declaring Flee as a Charge Reaction is subject to Minimised Roll. This does not apply if a unit fails to rally on the next friendly Player Turn or Flees involuntarily.%

}
\newcommand{\pathexileddef}{%
	Units with more than half of their models with Path of the Exiled \textbf{must} reroll failed Break Tests.
