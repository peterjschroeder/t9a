You gain one Veil Token that is not removed when the spell ends .
When a friendly unit within \distance{18} of the Caster suffers a wound before Special Saves, you may discard a Veil Token from your Veil Token pool and apply the following rules instead:
\begin{itemize}%
    \item No Special Save can be taken.%
    \item If the attack causing the wound has Multiple Wounds, it inflicts one wound less than usual. Otherwise, the wound is ignored.%    
\end{itemize}%
For Standard Infantry, up to 2 wounds are ignored per token provided they are suffered simultaneously. A maximum of two Veil Tokens may be discarded each phase for this purpose. Characters and  models with Towering Presence can only ignore a single wound this way per phase.%
