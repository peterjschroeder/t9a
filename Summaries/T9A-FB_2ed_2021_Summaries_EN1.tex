Charge Moves must be made so the following conditions are satisfied as best as possible, in decreasing priority order.

\begin{itemize}
\item \nth{1} priority: Make contact with no enemy units other than the one that was Charged. If it will be unavoidable to make contact with more than one enemy unit, make contact with as few enemy units as possible. Follow the rules for Multiple Charges.
\item \nth{2} priority: Maximise the total number of Charging units that make contact (note that this is only applicable when multiple units Charge the same unit).
\item \nth{3} priority: Avoid rotating the Charged unit. If it is unavoidable, rotate the unit as little as possible. Remember that units Engaged in Combat cannot be rotated.
\item \nth{4} priority: Maximise the number of models (on both sides) in base contact with at least one enemy model (including models fighting across gaps).

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
\item A friendly unit is destroyed within \distance{6} of the unit (including Fleeing off the board).
\item A friendly unit Breaks from Combat within \distance{6} of the unit.
\item A friendly unit Flees through the unit's Unit Boundary.
\item In a single phase, the unit suffers Health Point losses equal to or greater than \SI{25}{\percent} of the number of Health Points that it had at the start of the phase. This does not apply to single model units that started the game as a single model (i.e. with a starting number of 1 model on the Army List).
\end{itemize}

Units that fail a Panic Test Flee directly away from the closest enemy unit, or from the enemy unit which caused the Panic Test (Centre to Centre). Units do not take Panic Tests if they are Engaged in Combat, if they are already Fleeing, or if they already passed a Panic Test during this phase.

\item Reform (it can Combat Reform and Post-Combat Reform)

\item Declare Charges
\item Charge Reactions other than Flee
\item Move in any way other than a Flee Move
