\newcommand{\surprise}{Surprise!}%
\newcommand{\surprisedef}{%
	The model is not deployed normally. Instead it is said to be concealed inside the unit for which it was purchased. It is a unit upgrade, and as such is ignored when calculating Victory Points (its Point Cost is already included in the \goblin{} unit concealing it, and Victory Points are awarded for destroying the unit concealing it). Until released and moved out of its unit, the model cannot be harmed or otherwise affected, or affect the game in any way. When it is removed as a casualty, it does not cause Panic Tests. It still moves, acts, and is influenced by all rules independently like a normal unit (once released) and does not count towards the model count of the unit concealing it.\newline%
	It can be released in two ways:%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \madgits{} may be released when their unit declares a Stand and Shoot Charge Reaction with a Shooting Weapon (the unit still shoots as normal). If the unit does not have any Shooting Weapons, it may declare a Stand and Shoot Charge Reaction with \madgits{}. If so, all \madgits{} in the unit must be released. This is not considered a Shooting Attack.%
		\item At the start of the owner's Shooting Phase, if a unit with one or more concealed \madgits{} is not Engaged in Combat, not Fleeing, and is within \distance{8} of an enemy unit, it \textbf{must} immediately release all its \madgits{}.
	\end{itemize}
	Resolve released \madgits{} one at a time. Place the released \madgit{} just outside of base contact with the concealing unit and choose a direction to move the model in (ignore the \madgit{}'s \runningamok{}). This cannot be a direction that can potentially bring the released \madgit{} into contact with its concealing unit. When releasing the \madgit{}, move it in the chosen direction using the Shambolic rules. During this move, rolling the same result on all dice does not cause the \madgit{} to lose \Dthree{} \HealthPoints{} nor move in a random direction.%
