Files in this folder are only to be used to reduce size of Anurarchs page.

In order to do so, only some of the files here included are taken into account for compilation.

Masteries should be ordered by price followed by alphabetical order. The first four masteries will be listed in
anurarcharchmage.tex as opotions. The last three masteries will be included in anurarcharchmagecont.tex, were they
use special items format (which happens to be the same), and the files in this folder.

Therefore, in case masteries prices change, and order needs to be modified, the three last masteries have to be 
commented out in anurarcharchmage.tex, and included in anurarcharchmagecont.tex. For consistency reasons, it would
be good to update point values in all files.
